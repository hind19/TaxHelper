Overview
TaxHelper enables you to:
- Enter income payments manually or import them from a CSV file.
- Convert foreign currency amounts to UAH using daily exchange rates from NBU (or a configurable API).
- Calculate taxes based on configured tax rates.

Features
- WPF desktop app using MVVM
- Manual payment entry
- CSV import with configurable column mapping and delimiter
- Automatic currency conversion (per payment date)
- Configurable tax and military tax rates
- Simple dependency container for services

Requirements
- Windows with .NET 8 SDK
- IDE: JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio 2022, or VS Code (with C# extensions)

Getting started
Build and run
1) Open TaxHelper.sln with your IDE.
2) Ensure the startup project is TaxHelper.
3) Build and run the application (Debug/Any CPU is fine).

Configuration (App.config)
Application behavior is controlled via App.config located at TaxHelper/App.config. Defaults are provided and can be adjusted to match your data source and tax rules.

Currency exchange API
- BankCurrenceExchangeUrl: Base URL of the exchange rate API.
  - Default: https://bank.gov.ua/NBUStatService/v1/statdirectory/exchange
- CurrencyCodeParam: Query parameter name for currency code.
  - Default: valcode
- DateParam: Query parameter name for date.
  - Default: date
- AdditionalParams: Additional fixed parameters appended to every request (semicolon-separated; either key or key=value).
  - Default: json

The application builds a GET request like:
{BankCurrenceExchangeUrl}?{CurrencyCodeParam}=USD&{DateParam}=yyyyMMdd&json

If any required parameter is missing or empty, the app will report: "Параметы для запроса курсов валюты не настроены. См.ReadMe файл для дополнительной информации."

Tax rates (percent values)
- TaxRate: e.g., 5
- MilitaryTaxRate: e.g., 1

CSV import mapping
- PaymentDateColumn: CSV header name holding the payment date (e.g., DOC_DATE)
- PaymentAmountColumn: CSV header name holding the amount (e.g., CR)
- PaymentCurrencyColumn: CSV header name holding the currency code/number (e.g., CUR_NUMB)
- ColumnSplitter: Delimiter character (e.g., ;)

CSV import format
- First row must contain headers. The names must match the configured keys above.
- Example (with default settings):
  - Header: DOC_DATE;CR;CUR_NUMB
  - Row: 2024-12-30;100.50;USD

Usage
- Manual input
  - Add a payment using "+" or the Add control.
  - Enter PaymentDate, PaymentSum, and select PaymentCurrency.
  - When you change amount or currency, the app fetches the exchange rate for the selected date and recomputes PaymentSumUah.
- CSV import
  - Click Import CSV and choose a file with the structure described above.
  - The app validates headers and loads payments into the grid.
- Calculate tax
  - Click Calculate to compute taxes for all listed payments.
  - If any payment is invalid (sum <= 0 or currency not selected), the app will show an error.

Architecture overview
- MVVM
  - MainWindowVM: ViewModel driving the main screen. Holds Payments, orchestrates currency fetch and tax calculation.
- Services (resolved via a lightweight DependencyResolver)
  - TaxCalculation
    - ITaxCalculatorService, TaxCalculatorService: Aggregates payments and applies TaxRate and MilitaryTaxRate.
  - CurrencyCourse
    - IWebClientService, WebClientService: Calls exchange-rate API with parameters from App.config and returns the rate for a given currency and date.
  - CsvParser
    - ICsvParserService, CsvParserService: Reads CSV, maps columns per App.config, and produces PaymentModel instances.
  - PaymentCreation
    - IPaymentModelService, PaymentModelService: Creates PaymentModel objects from parsed CSV rows.
- Shared
  - DependencyResolver: Simple service locator used at startup (MainWindow.xaml.cs) to register implementations.
- Models
  - PaymentModel: Represents a single income payment (sum, currency, date, derived UAH sum).
  - TaxResultModel: Holds calculated totals.
- Enums
  - CurrenciesEnum: Supported currency codes including UAH.

Key flows
- Manual edit/import triggers recomputation of PaymentSumUah via WebClientService unless currency is UAH.
- Calculate command validates inputs and invokes ITaxCalculatorService to produce TaxesResult.

Troubleshooting
- Exchange rate errors
  - Verify App.config keys: BankCurrenceExchangeUrl, CurrencyCodeParam, DateParam, AdditionalParams.
  - Ensure the API endpoint is reachable and returns JSON compatible with NBU format: an array of objects containing "rate".
  - Check date format: the app uses yyyyMMdd (e.g., 20250117).
- CSV import errors
  - "Файл пустой или содержит только заголовки." — file must contain at least one data row.
  - "Файл не содержит необходимых заголовков…" — ensure headers exactly match configured names.
  - Verify ColumnSplitter matches your file’s delimiter.
- Validation errors during calculation
  - Ensure all PaymentSum values are greater than 0 and a PaymentCurrency is selected.

FAQ
- Which currencies are supported?
  - Those defined in CurrenciesEnum. For non-UAH, the app requests an exchange rate from the configured API.
- Can I use a different exchange API?
  - Yes. Update App.config keys to match your API’s base URL and parameter names. The service expects a JSON array where the first object includes a numeric "rate" field.
- How are dates formatted for the API?
  - yyyyMMdd, generated from the payment’s PaymentDate.
